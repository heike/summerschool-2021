## Motivating Example

```{setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk(warning = FALSE)
```

- Kick things off by looking at a real data set in R
- Goal: get the flavor of using R for data management and exploration
- Don't worry about understanding all the coding right away
- We will come back to see how everything works in detail

## Palmer Penguins

- Allison Horst: data on 344 penguins from three different species and three islands over three years
- https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/

- data consists of observations on nesting penguins 
- several variables recorded:
    - body measures of penguins: bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass
    - year
    - species
    - location
    - penguin's sex (determined by blood test)
- __Primary Question__: Can sex be determined without blood test?

## Follow along 

Copy & paste the code into the console:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
curl::curl_download(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heike/summerschool-2021/master/01-Introduction-to-R/code/1-example.R",
  "1-example.R"
)
file.edit("1-example.R")
```


## First look at data in R

Lets use R to look at the top few rows of the data set. First, we load the penguins data  `read.csv`:

```{r}
penguins <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heike/summerschool-2021/main/01-Introduction-to-R/data/penguins.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Now, we use the `head` function to look at the first 6 rows of the data:

```{r}
head(penguins)
```

## Penguins Data Attributes

How big is this data set and what types of variables are in each column?

```{r}
str(penguins)
```

- python has pandas ... R has data.frames
- data.frames are lists of variables 


## Penguins Variables

Let's get a summary of the values for each variable in penguins:

```{r}
summary(penguins)
```

# How do penguins' body measurements relate to each other?

## Scatterplots: bill length versus flipper length 

First, we need to install and load `ggplot2`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=3, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point()
```

## 

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=3, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point()
```

There seem to be some clusters

Correlation is below 0.70, but there is a positive linear relationship in some clusters
```{r}
cor(penguins$bill_length_mm, penguins$flipper_length_mm, use = "pairwise")
```


## Color points

Color  points by sex of the penguins, each of the clusters seem to be split about 50/50.

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=4, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = sex)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Closer look

Clusters are related to different species

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=4, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Clusters of penguins

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=4, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) 
```

## Back to trying to determine gender

Lets look distribution of body mass with a histogram

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 100)
```
## Back to trying to determine sex of penguins

Lets look distribution of body mass with a histogram colored by sex

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, fill= sex)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 100)
```


## Body mass and sex of penguins

We can use facetting by species 

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=10, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, fill= sex)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +
  facet_grid(.~species)
```

## Body mass and sex of penguins

We can use facetting by species 

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=10, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% filter(!is.na(sex)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, fill= sex)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(.~species)
```

## 

Look at the average body mass for Gentoo penguins separately:

```{r}
gentoo <- filter(penguins, species=="Gentoo")

mean(gentoo$body_mass_g[gentoo$sex == "male"], na.rm=TRUE)
mean(gentoo$body_mass_g[gentoo$sex == "female"], na.rm=TRUE)
```


## Statistical Significance

There is a difference but is it statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(body_mass_g ~ sex, data = gentoo)
```

## Your Turn {data-background=#2a374c}

Try playing with chunks of code from this session to further investigate the penguins data:

1. What is the relationship between penguins bill length and bill depth? What is the correlation? Would you expect the same correlation for all species?
2. What is the median (`median`) bill depths for Adelie and Gentoo penguins? (make sure to use `na.rm = TRUE` to exclude missing values)
3. Is body mass discriminating between male and female Adelie penguins as well as Gentoo penguins?
