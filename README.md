    - double-click the file `Start-here.Rproj` to start RStudio with the right material 
    - go into folder `01-introduction-to-R` and open the file `0-getting started.Rmd` in the `knitr` folder.
- **hands-on** (alternative): 
    - in case you are experiences problems with the installation, you can make use of the [RStudio cloud server](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/66686/project/2558446?idle=1621215820362).
